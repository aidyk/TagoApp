Disclaimer: I do not own this code, which is reverse-engineered from the
Tago App 2.1.1 originally delveoped by liber8tech. 

Here is a short story,
Back then Sep, 2019, the dedicated image sync server for tago arc has started to be unstable, 
and around May. 2020, it was completely down. Since the tago arc is nothing without the Tago App, 
I reverse-engineered it and managed to make it work again so as to keep the Tago arc alive.
The only changes from the original code are
1. bypassing login
2. bypassing image sync
all of the aboves require a communication with the sync server which is currently down.

I'm willing to quit this project at any time if the liber8tech developement team is back.

If you have any question or inquiry, feel free to send me (a.i@acm.org) an email.
