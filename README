Disclaimer: I do not own this code, which is reverse-engineered from the
Tago App 2.1.1 originally delveoped by liber8tech. 

There are code changes only for making tagoapp work standalone, e.g., bypassing login step/image sync, etc.

I'm willing to quit this project at any time whenever the liber8tech developement team is back.

If you have any question or inquiry, feel free to send me (a.i@acm.org) an email.
